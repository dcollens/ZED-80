Getting Started
===============

You need sdcc v4.0.0 or newer to build the CP/M C library and .COM programs in this directory.
    sudo port install sdcc
    brew install sdcc

You also need the srecord package for the srec_cat tool.
    sudo port install srecord
    brew install srecord

To build the latest library and .COM programs:
    make

To clean the build products:
    make clean

After you've build these products, you will want to include them in an updated SD card image:
    cd ../zed-80
    make updatesdcard

Then you can use them from the emulator, or write the SD card image to a physical card and boot
it on the real ZED-80 hardware.
